                      <p>My name is Tavita Bucio.  I am a senior and this is my first year in JMG.  The way that JMG has been an influence in my life is that I have met some  amazing students who want to make a difference in the world.  Throughout high school, I never really had a group of friends with whom I really fit in. The students in this program love to volunteer and do positive things for others, and I love being a part of this group.  I have more opportunities to  give back to the community than I would have known about had it not been for this program.  It means a lot to me to be able to do things for the community. My plan for after high school is to work towards being in the child care service. A fun fact about me is that my middle name is just the letter A. </p>
